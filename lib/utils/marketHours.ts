// ── DSE-corroborated market state ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// isMarketOpenServer() above is calendar-only, and the calendar is a
// hand-maintained list of predicted dates. On 2026-08-25 a wrong entry in it
// (a projected Eid date; the real one was the 26th) reported the market
// closed for a full live session while DSE was trading ~50,000 executions.
// Every order that day was rejected. The calendar is a guess being trusted
// as ground truth.
//
// api/market_sync.py now also captures DSE's own "Market Status: Open" from
// the same board it scrapes for prices, and app/api/stock-sync stores it on
// market_info/latest. That is the exchange stating its own state, so it
// outranks our calendar in BOTH directions:
//
//   - calendar says closed, DSE says Open  → trade (a bad holiday date can
//     no longer take the feature offline)
//   - calendar says open, DSE says Closed  → don't trade (a MISSING holiday
//     can no longer let people trade a frozen board)
//
// Deliberate limits, so this can't become its own outage:
//   - The status only counts while fresh. Price sync runs every ~3 minutes;
//     if the cron dies or DSE is unreachable, nothing is written and the
//     stored status goes stale, at which point we ignore it and fall back
//     to the calendar rather than acting on an old reading.
//   - An unparseable/absent status is "no opinion", never "closed".
//   - Time-of-day is still enforced from the clock, not from DSE's status,
//     so a stuck "Open" can't extend the session past 14:15.
