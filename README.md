SkillDash üöÄ
Don't know what your skills are? Part-time Job? Skill Learning? Resume Feedback? All in one SkillDash Platform!

SkillDash is a gamified, AI-powered web platform designed to bridge the critical skill gap for university and college students in Bangladesh. Traditional education often leaves students unprepared for the real-world job market. SkillDash transforms this experience by making skill discovery, learning, and career preparation an engaging and continuous journey.

Our mission is to empower the next generation of Bangladeshi talent, turning academic knowledge into a verified, employable skillset and connecting learners directly to economic opportunities.

All-in-One Platform Features
SkillDash integrates every step of the career readiness journey into a single, cohesive platform. Here‚Äôs how we address each question:

üîç Don't know what your skills are? AI Skill Discovery
Our platform kicks off with a fun, interactive AI-powered quiz. Instead of boring forms, you'll answer scenario-based questions and solve simple puzzles.

The AI analyzes your responses to identify your natural aptitudes and hidden talents, suggesting which skills you're most likely to excel at and enjoy.

üéÆ Skill Learning? Gamified Pathways
Embark on "Skill Quests"‚Äîshort, practical challenges that simulate real-world tasks in areas like communication, digital marketing, problem-solving, and basic coding.

Earn XP (Experience Points), unlock badges, and level up your profile as you complete quests. Your progress is a visible achievement you can be proud of.

Get recommendations for AI-powered micro-courses and link directly to content from partners like GP Academy to deepen your knowledge.

ü§ñ Resume Feedback? AI Career Tools
Our AI Coach is available 24/7 to provide instant feedback on your resume, helping you tailor it to specific job applications.

SkillDash automatically builds a dynamic "SkillDash Resume" for you‚Äîa visually engaging, verified record of the skills you've mastered and the quests you've completed on the platform.

üíº Part-time Job? Integrated Opportunity Board
As you level up, you unlock exclusive access to a curated job and freelance board.

We partner with leading companies to bring you relevant internships, part-time roles, and freelance gigs, allowing you to start earning and gaining real-world experience while you're still studying.
